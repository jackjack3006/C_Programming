Digital image processing is the exercise of computer algorithms to perform image processing on digital images
as a subcategory or field of digital signal processing 
Digital image processing has various advantages over analog image processing
It permits a much spacious range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and can be avoid problems such as the build-up of noise and signal distortion during processing 
Since images are defined over multi dimensions digital image processing may be modeled in the form of multidimensional systems (Digital Image Processing) 
First of all it should be known that what is digital image
A digital image is a representation of a two-dimensional image as a finite set of digital values, called picture elements or pixels, where Pixel values typically represent gray levels, colors, heights, opacities etc
Digitization implies that a digital image is an approximation of a real scene.
